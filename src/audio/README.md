# Audio Files

This directory contains audio files used by the IMAGE browser extension for providing auditory feedback to users during various stages of the rendering process.

## Files

- **IMAGE-Error.mp3**: Played when an error occurs during the rendering process
- **IMAGE-Processing.mp3**: Played when the extension is processing an image
- **IMAGE-RequestSent.mp3**: Played when a request is sent to the IMAGE server
- **IMAGE-ResultsArrived.mp3**: Played when results arrive from the IMAGE server

## Usage

These audio files provide important non-visual cues to users, particularly those who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies. They help users understand the current state of the extension without requiring visual feedback.

The audio files are played at appropriate times during the extension's operation, such as when a request is sent to the server or when results are received.
