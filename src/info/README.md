# Rendering Information Display

This directory contains files related to displaying information about renderings in the IMAGE browser extension.

## Files

- **info.html**: HTML template for the rendering information page
- **info.ts**: JavaScript for handling the rendering information display
- **info-utils.ts**: Utility functions for the rendering information display
- **info.css**: Styles for the rendering information page

## Functionality

The files in this directory are responsible for:

1. **Rendering Display**: Showing the renderings generated by the IMAGE server
2. **Audio Playback**: Providing controls for playing audio renderings
3. **Text Display**: Showing text renderings for screen readers
4. **User Feedback**: Offering links to provide feedback about renderings
5. **Rendering Selection**: Allowing users to select different renderings if multiple are available

## Usage

When a user requests an accessible rendering of an image, chart, or map, and the IMAGE server successfully generates renderings, the extension displays these renderings on the information page.

The information page includes:
- A title indicating that these are IMAGE extension renderings
- A container for displaying the renderings
- Controls for interacting with the renderings (e.g., playing audio)
- A footer with links to provide feedback

Users can interact with the renderings in various ways, such as playing audio renderings, reading text renderings, or exploring tactile renderings if available.
