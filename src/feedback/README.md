# Feedback Collection

This directory contains files related to collecting user feedback in the IMAGE browser extension.

## Files

- **feedback.html**: HTML template for the feedback form
- **feedback.ts**: JavaScript for handling feedback submission

## Functionality

The files in this directory are responsible for:

1. **Feedback Collection**: Providing a form for users to submit feedback about the extension
2. **Data Privacy**: Ensuring users understand how their feedback data will be used
3. **Consent Management**: Obtaining user consent for saving request data for analysis
4. **Form Submission**: Handling the submission of feedback to the IMAGE team

## Usage

Users can access the feedback form in several ways:
- From the rendering information page
- From error pages
- From the extension's options page

The feedback form explains to users that normally, the IMAGE team does not keep or view information such as the graphic, URL, or user settings. However, users can consent to have this information saved to help improve the extension.

The form emphasizes the importance of not including personal information in the feedback or in the graphics being shared.

Once the user completes the form, they can submit it to the IMAGE team for review.
