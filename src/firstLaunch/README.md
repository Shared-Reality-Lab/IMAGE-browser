## Files

- **firstLaunch.css**: Styles for the first launch page
- **firstLaunch.html**: HTML template for the first launch page
- **firstLaunch.ts**: JavaScript for handling the first launch experience

## Functionality

The files in this directory are responsible for:

1. **Welcome Message**: Displaying a welcome message to new users
2. **Onboarding**: Providing initial guidance on how to use the extension
3. **Documentation Links**: Offering links to more detailed documentation
4. **First-time Setup**: Helping users configure the extension for first use

## Usage

When a user installs the IMAGE browser extension for the first time, the extension automatically displays the first launch page. This page welcomes the user to the extension and provides a link to the quickstart guide at https://image.a11y.mcgill.ca/pages/quickstart.html.

The first launch page is designed to be simple and straightforward, providing just enough information to get users started without overwhelming them with details.

Users can close the first launch page by clicking the closing button, after which they can begin using the extension.
